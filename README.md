Beat the Bugs! (A Frogger arcade game clone)
===============================

## Project Overview

A project for Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The task was to recreate a classic arcade game with provided visual assets and a game loop engine by adding player characters and enemies using objects and prototype inheritances.

### How to play
The game can be played [here](https://r-farnsworth.github.io/arcade-game-clone/).
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your player to the water without hitting the bugs!

### Issues
Any problems encountered can be submitted via the Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/r-farnsworth/arcade-game-clone/issues)
