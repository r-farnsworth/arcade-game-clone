## Project Overview

A project for Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The task was to recreate the classic arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) with provided visual assets and a game loop engine by adding player characters and enemies using objects and prototype inheritances.

### How to play
The game can be played [here](https://r-farnsworth.github.io/arcade-game-clone/)
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your player to the water without hitting the bugs!
